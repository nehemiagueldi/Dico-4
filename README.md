# Dico-4
## COVID-19 Diagnosis Tool
This is a web application that helps users diagnose whether they may have COVID-19 based on their symptoms and medical history. The application also checks for other common diseases that may have similar symptoms to COVID-19. It's built using PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and it's hosted on 000webhostapp.com (https://dico-4.000webhostapp.com/).

This project was developed as a group project as a final task for a course. The project was developed by a team of developers with same major.

## How it works
The user is presented with a series of questions about their symptoms and medical history. The user selects the appropriate response for each question, and the application uses a set of rules to determine whether the user may have COVID-19. 

To diagnosing COVID-19, the application also checks for other common diseases that may have similar symptoms, such as the flu, allergies, and strep throat. The application uses a database of symptoms and diseases to make the diagnosis.

The user is presented with a summary of their diagnosis, which includes the likelihood of having COVID-19 and other potential diseases. The user is also provided with recommendations on what to do next based on their diagnosis.

The application stores the user's responses in a MySQL database, which can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.
